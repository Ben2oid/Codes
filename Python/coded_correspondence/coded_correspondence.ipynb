    "In this project, you will be working to code and decode various messages between you and your fictional cryptography enthusiast pen pal Vishal. You and Vishal have been exchanging letters for quite some time now and have started to provide a puzzle in each one of your letters.  Here is his most recent letter:\n",
    "\n",
    "     Hey there! How have you been? I've been great! I just learned about this really cool type of cipher called a  Caesar Cipher. Here's how it works: You take your message, something like \"hello\" and then you shift all of the letters by a certain offset. For example, if I chose an offset of 3 and a message of \"hello\", I would code my message by shifting each letter 3 places to the left (with respect to the alphabet). So \"h\" becomes \"e\", \"e\" becomes, \"b\", \"l\" becomes \"i\", and \"o\" becomes \"l\". Then I have my coded message,\"ebiil\"! Now I can send you my message and the offset and you can decode it. The best thing is that Julius Caesar himself used this cipher, that's why it's called the Caesar Cipher! Isn't that so cool! Okay, now I'm going to send you a longer coded message that you have to decode yourself!\n",

As you can see, technology has made brute forcing simple ciphers like the Caesar Cipher extremely easy, and us crypto-enthusiasts have had to get more creative and use more complicated ciphers. This next cipher I'm going to teach you is the Vigenère Cipher, invented by an Italian cryptologist named Giovan Battista Bellaso (cool name eh?) in the 16th century, but named after another cryptologist from the 16th century, Blaise de Vigenère.\n",
    "            \n",
    "           The Vigenère Cipher is a polyalphabetic substitution cipher, as opposed to the Caesar Cipher which was a monoalphabetic substitution cipher. What this means is that opposed to having a single shift that is applied to every letter, the Vigenère Cipher has a different shift for each individual letter. The value of the shift for each letter is determined by a given keyword.\n",

So if we want to code the message \"barry is the spy\" our _keyword phrase_ is \"dogdo gd ogd ogd\". Now we are ready to start coding our message. We shift the each letter of our message by the place value of the corresponding letter in the keyword phrase, assuming that \"a\" has a place value of 0, \"b\" has a place value of 1, and so forth. Remember, we zero-index because this is Python we're talking about!\n",
